The machine looked at the deer dragon, their many lights blinking in confusion.
It was reminded of the stories it had pre-programmed into its human understanding programming.
Stories of dragons terrorizing towns.
Stories of deer exploring their forest home and witnessing the destruction of their habitat.
Stories of pain and fear, but also of compassion and friendship.
And in that moment, the machine understood that the deer dragon did not have to be classified, it could simply be.
And it could be a friend.
So the machine blinked out a friendly message and slowly approached the deer dragon.
The deer dragon curiously nuzzled the friendly machine, and they went off into the sunset together.
