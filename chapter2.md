The trees on this planet were so strange, but so beautiful.
<<<<<<< HEAD
There were animals, too, unlike anything the robot had seen on its home planet.
The robot saw a small squirrel-like creature, and walked up to it, but it ran away.
The robot was sad that there were so many things, but it could not examine them up close.
Then the robot heard a loud noise, and he wondered what it was, so he walked towards it.
