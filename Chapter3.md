The robot stumbles upon a strange looking animal.
What is this oddly-designed form of life?
What master would create such a thing?
"Not mine," it thinks. "Just look at me, I am perfect, it is not," the robot says to itself.
The animal looks like a deer, but also like a dragon.
The robot decides it will be called a deer dragon.
The deer dragon looks very friendly, and it begins to walk towards the robot.
The robot is not scared, because the robot has no feelings.
