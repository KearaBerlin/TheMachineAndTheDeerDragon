The robot stumbles upon a strange looking animal.
What is this oddly-designed form of life?
What master would create such a thing?
"Not mine," it thinks. "Just look at me, I am perfect, it is not," the robot says to itself.

The deer dragon breaths hot fire and begins to walk towards the robot.
The animal looks like a deer, but also like a dragon.
"Is it a dragon?" the machine mused. "Or is it more deer?"
"Perhaps some proportion of each?"
The machine began running its calculations on how best to classify the deer dragon until the deer dragon turned and looked the machine right in the lens.  
The deer dragon looks very friendly, and it begins to walk towards the robot.
